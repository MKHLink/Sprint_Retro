## The best way to interpret user needs is by asking questions and using their feedback to write stories. Creating a user persona, and using them to write a story that represts the feature to be implemented is a great way to start the impelementation preocess. "User stories" help by breaking down a large feature into segmented tasks with clear direction for developers, with a clear acceptance criteria.

## Breaking down tasks into user stories and pointing them in terms of their complexity is a great way to approach developing programs. These combined with test driven development are the Agile practices I hope to constantly incorporate into my future development work.

## A good team member helps identify the strengths of the team and assigns stories accordinly. They would also help in knowledge transfer among the team so there is an evenm distribution of skills and knowledge. Above all, a good team member is always open to communication and has a desire to learn and grow.
